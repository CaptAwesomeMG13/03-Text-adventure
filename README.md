# 03-Text-adventure

This text adventure is an original adventure made by yours truly.
In this adventure you will explore the everyday life of Jake from Farm State.
He does not live a very interesting life and has mostly long days at work.
Show him the way home and stop to get some food along the way cause he needs it.
The main goal is to get Jake in bed. Thats how to win the game.
Take as many turns as you would like to get him food or explore his home town.
If you want to quit early just type QUIT.

The main.py and gameEngine.py are the ones you want to play in.
The other one wont take you to this beautiful game.
In main.py when it asks you which one to play, select game.json.
The other .json files are not my created games and I cannot take credit for their work.
From there you can beginning your adventure.
The basic movements for most of the game are Left, Right, or Straight.
I'm sure you can figure out the rest from there. 
Good Luck at getting Jake home!!
