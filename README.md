# 03-Text-adventure
Text Adventure Game Repository for third week of class

The purpose of this project is to create a game engine capable of generating an Interactive Fiction game based on an external description file. In this case, I have provided a stripped-down version of the venerable game Zork, that you will be able to test with.

Don't panic! We will be working through the creation of this code in class. You will also have opportunities to express your creativity as you make the game description file.

If you need help validating or formatting your json file, I recommend jsonformatter.org. (Links to an external site.)

When you are satisfied with your efforts. Commit (and push) your changes to GitHub, and turn in the URL to your repository on Canvas.

The grading criteria will be as follows:

[1 point] Assignment turned in on time
[1] Repository contains an appropriate software license
[2] Repository contains a descriptive README.md
[1] Requires Python 3
[1] No syntax errors
[8] Accomplishes the objective of the assignment
